# Double pendulum simulation

Runs using Python 3 and Pygame.
Pygame can be installed easiest using Python's `pip` module.

Adjust the initial angle, anglular velocity, angular acceleration,
mass of both bobs, length of both rods holding the bobs together,
as well as the gravitational constant and scale using the variables
defined near the top of the file.

Formula for the calculation of the angular acceleration adapted from
the differential equation found [here](https://web.mit.edu/jorloff/www/chaosTalk/double-pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html).
